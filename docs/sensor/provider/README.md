# Sensor Data Sources

Sensor values are read directly from the system by `asterctl` using the integrated
[aster-sysinfo](sysinfo.md) library. No external scripts or intermediate files are needed.

- [Internal date time sensors](internal_date_time.md)
- [aster-sysinfo](sysinfo.md) — integrated system sensor library and standalone CLI tool

### Legacy

The following data providers are no longer needed but are kept for reference:

- [Text file data source](text_file.md) (legacy)
- [Shell scripts](shell_scripts.md) (legacy)
